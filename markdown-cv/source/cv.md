### Personal summary

> Although my previous career was as a marine ecologist, I have been exploring modern, computational approaches in biological research and experimental design. I have worked in a wide variety of roles, most recently as a bioinformatician with a consultancy, Fios Genomics. At Fios genomics we work with mainly industrial clients involved in clinical trials, ti apply best practice statistical methods to clinical, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Prior to Fios, I was a bioinformatician at Glasgow Polyomics working on the ISSF projects. In previous roles, I have lead research expeditions in the UK and Kenya and I have worked collaboratively with Scottish and international scientists on various marine research topic. I have presented research at international, national and local meetings, to varied audiences throughout my research career.
