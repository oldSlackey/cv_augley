Personal Profile
================

Although my previous career was as a marine ecologist, for more recent
roles I have been exploring modern, computational approaches in
biological research and experimental design. I have worked in a wide
variety of roles, most recently as a bioinformatician with a
consultancy, Fios Genomics. At Fios genomics we work with mainly
industrial clients involved in clinical trials, to apply best practice
statistical methods to clinical, genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic
datasets. Prior to Fios, I was a bioinformatician at Glasgow Polyomics
working on the ISSF projects, mainly working on high-throughput
sequencing data. In previous roles, I have lead research expeditions in
the UK and Kenya and I have worked collaboratively with Scottish and
international scientists on various marine research projects. I have
presented research at international, national and local meetings, to
varied audiences throughout my research career.
